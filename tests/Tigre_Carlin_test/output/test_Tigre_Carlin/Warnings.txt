OFF-TARGET AMPLIFICATION

Insignificant off-target amplification detected. Only 1% of reads are off-target.

FILTERING

Sequencing depth insufficent. Low number of reads detected in FASTQ.

ANALYSIS

Number of common UMIs is low (207). Common UMIs account for only 7% of reads. This is likely due to:
 - low sequencing depth so that many UMIs do not exceed the required threshold

RESULTS

Template allele was not the most common allele. Since significant preferential amplification of short sequences was not detected and most common UMIs called alleles successfully, this may indicate over-exposure to +Dox as most alleles are highly degraded
